## Introduction

Last year, I tried something crazy! After working for 20 years in Banking software as a software engineer using C++, I decided I wanted to attempt a Career shift into Web Development. Not a very big shift, I know! It is, however, a shift in technologies, culture, development practices and just in the way we think about software and the way we write it. I love to write software... Good software that is well written, easy to maintain and beautiful to read. 

Then something significant happened. The company I was working for (a big multi-national with thousands of employees Worldwide) was downsizing and offering an awesome severence package for those who wanted to take it. It seemed like the time was right to follow the dream. I said goodbye and turned my attention to what I really wanted to do. 

Confucius once said *A man who loves his job never works a day in his life* 

## Skills

I have worked with a number of technologies over the last twenty years. I don't want to bore you with a long list of them so here are some highlights.

### Languages

Whilst most of my career up to date has involved using C++, I am a bit of a polyglot and language nut. Perl used to be my 'go to' language when I wanted to script something on the command line. Then I discovered Ruby, the community around the language, it's tools and paradigms. For the last four years, it has been my language of choice for personal projects. Recently I have started to use Javascript even more. I had heard horror stories about its weirdness and strange ways of doing things but I must say I have a liking for it. Nobody is more surprised than me! I also love to dabble in Coffeescript and am looking forward to the day that ES6 gains traction. Other highlights would be HTML5 and CSS3 because of their simplicity and power. I have also taught myself some of the functional programming languages such as Elixir and Clojure.

I like to [blog](http://deathray1977.net/thinking/) about my musings on different languages and technologies too.

### Frameworks

I have been working in different front-end and back-end web frameworks and really like the way they can speed up the process of creating an application. I love the 'convention over configuration' approach of Ruby on Rails. I think the speed and performance of Node.js with Express is something that cannot be overlooked. For simpler applications, I like to use Sinatra. I love front-end frameworks like Angular.js for its simplicity of design, dependancy injection and extensions to HTML. JQuery is also I great library built on Javascript that I enjoy using and look forward to using more in the future. I would consider myself to be a 'journeyman' in all these technologies. 

### Testing 

I love to develop using Test Driven Development (TDD). In Ruby I reach for Rspec. For Javascript, I love to use Jasmine. For Behavior Driven Development, I love the simplicity of technologies such as Cucumber, Protractor and Capybara.

### Other Skills

I have built upon a number of other skills over the last twenty years. I started my career as a Graduate Programmer and worked my way up to a Senior Developer and Software architect. I have worked on the full software lifecycle from requirements gathering, design using OOD, programming using OOP, Integration and System testing. I have used many tools for software change control such as Git, Clearcase and CVS.

## Career so far

**April 2015 – October 2015: Web and Application Support Officer, London Borough of Hounslow**
Working in the Business Systems department providing support for essential systems used in the council to provide services to the public. I am particularly proud of the way I helped to keep an essential system that deals with vulnerable children up and running with 100% availability.

**2009 – June 2014: Lead Software Developer, Visa Europe, Reading**
Lead Software Developer in the online transactions development team. Delivering new features to the business critical payments system that boasts 99.8% availability and can process thousands of transactions per second. Each time you pay for anything using a Visa credit or debit card, it is processed using software developed by our team. A number of projects stand out for me as something that I can feel proud of. One such project was when I refactored C++ class to optimise system performance to handle ever increasing transaction volumes. Transaction throughput in the system went up by 150%.


**1994 – 2009: Graduate Developer to Software Architect, ACI Worldwide (EMEA), Watford**
This is where I started my development career. My very first project as a rookie was to upgrade a major Dutch bank to the latest version of our codebase. This involved retrofitting all of their bespoke code into the latest vanilla codebase. This took six months to complete and I was even sent to Amsterdam to deliver and test the code. For a first project, I was pretty proud to see money being dispensed from a Dutch ATM using code that I had written. My time at ACI allowed me to travel to lots of really cool places. My last project was to be part of a team tasked to create a new payments system for Visa Europe that would allow them to process credit card payments more efficiently. This allowed me to travel and work in sunny California for nine months. Thanks to the work of this team, the client now has a system built upon OOD and OOP that can be modified to add new functionality really easily.

## Obsessions

*An active mind is a healthy mind*

My interests are very much intertwined with my career. I love to keep abreast of new technologies and programming languages. I like to attend Tech meetups in London when I can. I practice yoga regularly as it is good for both mind and body. I play wheelchair tennis and like to get outdoors on long walks to clear the mind of the clutter of everyday life. I like to play guitar. I sometimes like to binge watch whole TV series during the long nights of winter.
