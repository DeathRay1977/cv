# Norm Fasey

## Introduction

Last year, I tried something crazy! After working for 20 years in Banking software as a software engineer using mainly C++, I decided I wanted to attempt a Career shift into other areas of Software development. 

Then something significant happened. The company I was working for (a big multi-national with thousands of employees Worldwide) was downsizing and offering an awesome severence package for those who wanted to take it. It seemed like the time was right to follow the dream. I said goodbye and turned my attention to what I really wanted to do. 

I love to write software... Good software that is well written, easy to maintain and beautiful to read. I am looking for a role that will allow me to build on my past experience and expand into new and exciting areas of Software engineering.

Confucius once said *A man who loves his job never works a day in his life* 

## Skills

### Working with large codebases.

I have worked on software applications with very large line counts. I became very skilled at managing complex merges and integration testing of new functionality into those codebases. The products I worked at Visa Europe and ACI where both over 300,000 lines of code and rising each day. This code was being contibuted to by over 100 developers.

### C++ Programming

I have coded in C++ for 17 years of my 20 year career in software development. I also contributed to the open source Darkcoin (cryptocurrency) project which is written in C++.

### Learning new languages

I have taught myself many programming languages and paradigms during the last 20 years. Such as Elixir, Clojure and Python. I pick up new languages pretty quickly. This is because of my Computer Science background.

### Problem Solving

I enjoy: 

* Finding those elusive bugs in code. 
* Devising creative solutions to hard to solve problems. 

### Refactoring code

I enjoy refactoring code to make it perform better. One such project was when I worked at Visa Europe and refactored C++ class to optimise system performance to handle ever increasing transaction volumes. Transaction throughput in the system went up by 150%.

### Mentoring

* Mentored junior developers in the effective use of the C++ programming language whilst working for ACI. 

### Object Oriented Design

* I have designed new features for applications at both ACI and Visa Europe and documented them using tools such as Rational Rose and UML.

## Obsessions

*An active mind is a healthy mind*

My interests are very much intertwined with my career. I love to keep abreast of new technologies and programming languages. I like to attend Tech meetups in London when I can. I practice yoga regularly as it is good for both mind and body. I play wheelchair tennis and like to get outdoors on long walks to clear the mind of the clutter of everyday life. I like to play guitar [badly]. I sometimes like to binge watch whole TV series during the long nights of winter.

I like to [blog](http://deathray1977.net/thinking/) about my musings on different languages and technologies too.
