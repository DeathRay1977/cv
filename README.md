# Norm Fasey

## Introduction

Last year, I tried something crazy! After working for 20 years in Banking software as a software engineer using C++, I decided I wanted to attempt a Career shift into Web Development. Not a very big shift, I know! It is, however, a shift in technologies, culture, development practices and the way we think about and write software. I love to write software... Good software that is well written, easy to maintain and beautiful to read. 

Then something significant happened. The company I was working for (a big multi-national with thousands of employees Worldwide) was downsizing and offering an awesome severence package for those who wanted to take it. It seemed like the time was right to follow the dream. I said goodbye and turned my attention to what I really wanted to do. 

Confucius once said *A man who loves his job never works a day in his life*

## Career so far

**April 2015 – October 2015: Web and Application Support Officer, London Borough of Hounslow**
Working in the Business Systems department providing support for essential systems used in the council to provide services to the public. I am particularly proud of the way I helped to keep an essential system that deals with vulnerable children up and running with 100% availability.

**2009 – June 2014: Lead Software Developer, Visa Europe, Reading**
Lead Software Developer in the online transactions development team. A number of projects stand out for me as something that I can feel proud of. One such project was when I refactored C++ class to optimise system performance to handle ever increasing transaction volumes. Transaction throughput in the system went up by 150%.


**1994 – 2009: Graduate Developer to Software Architect, ACI Worldwide (EMEA), Watford**
My time at ACI allowed me to travel to lots of really cool places. My last project was to be part of a team tasked to create a new payments system for Visa Europe that would allow them to process credit card payments more efficiently. This allowed me to travel and work in sunny California for nine months. Thanks to the work of this team, the client now has a system built upon OOD and OOP that can be modified to add new functionality really easily.

## Obsessions

*An active mind is a healthy mind*

My interests are very much intertwined with my career. I love to keep abreast of new technologies and programming languages. I like to attend Tech meetups in London when I can. I practice yoga regularly as it is good for both mind and body. I play wheelchair tennis and like to get outdoors on long walks to clear the mind of the clutter of everyday life. I like to play guitar [badly]. I sometimes like to binge watch whole TV series during the long nights of winter.

I like to [blog](http://deathray1977.net/thinking/) about my musings on different languages and technologies too.
